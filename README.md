## Building and running

Clone this repository and open it in Android Studio. You should be able to build and run it without any special considerations. To test the app you'll need to provide a Github personal access token though. [This tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line/) shows how to generate a token. It needs to have "repo" scope. Below is a step-by-step guide that should work. The linked tutorial goes more in-depth.

**Guide**: Click your profile photo in the upper right corner > Settings > Developer Settings > Personal Access Tokens > Generate new token > Give it "repo" scope > enter token in Preferences activity of app > Profit!
